# steady_thin_film_PLANAR
Numerical ODE solution for a steady thin liquid film in the 2D planar coordinate system. The problem is set up in the main.m file. The ODE solution begins at the bulk end of the thin film with known film height and derivatives and interface temperature. Vapor and wall temparatures are defined constants/functions. Fluid properties are defined by polynomial functions of temperature contained within the fluidData.mat file; currently defined for Argon between 100-150K.
